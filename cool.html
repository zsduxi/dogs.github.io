  <!-- history of dogs-->
  <body><h3 class="green"> Dogs are the first tame animals. They have been with humans for at least 20,000 years and possibly as many as 40,000. Scientists say that all dogs, domestic and wild, share a common ancestor. At some point wolves and dogs went on their separate evolutionary ways.
